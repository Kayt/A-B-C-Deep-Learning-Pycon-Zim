# A-B-C-Deep-Learning-Pycon-Zim
An Introductory Deep Learning Tutorial for PyCon Zimbabwe 2018. This repo is will help anyone who wants to start deep learning with a few trained models of the most common Deep Learning Architectures. The first tutorial will cover the neural network basics to get each and everyone up to speed with the technology and content involved.

To be covered are the following:
* Articifial Neural Networks 
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Recurrent Neural Networks
